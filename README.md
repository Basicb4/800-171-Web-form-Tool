USE WINZIP to put the zip pieces back together

I am attaching the zip of iText 4.1.6. I DID NOT MAKE THIS. All of its rights belong to its respective owners and it falls under the legal sanctions they have in place. I am placing it here solely for ease of finding since it is required in this tool. Thanks!
